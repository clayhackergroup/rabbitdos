🐰 RabbitDOS - Powerful DoS & DDoS Attack Tool



RabbitDOS is an advanced DoS (Denial of Service) & DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack tool designed for security testing and research. This tool simulates real-world attack scenarios to help security professionals test web applications against DoS threats.


---

⚡ Features

✅ Perform DoS & DDoS attacks on web targets
✅ Supports HTTP, TCP, and UDP flood attacks
✅ Fast & efficient with multi-threading
✅ Bypass some security protections
✅ User-friendly bash script for easy execution


---

📥 Installation

Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/clayhackergroup/rabbitdos
cd rabbitdos

Give Execution Permission

chmod +x run.sh

Install Dependencies

bash install.sh


---

🚀 Usage

Run the Tool

bash run.sh
# OR
./run.sh




🛠️ How It Works?

RabbitDOS sends massive amounts of requests to the target server, aiming to overload resources and cause downtime. It utilizes different DoS attack techniques like:

SYN Flood (TCP handshake exhaustion)

UDP Flood (High packet rate attack)

HTTP Flood (Overloading the target with HTTP requests)


This helps security researchers and penetration testers analyze web application defenses.
